*An inter-university collective that explores creative potential through interdisciplinary collaboration.*
<br/><br/>
# Mission
<hr/>
We strive to break down interdisciplinary barriers between artists, designers, and engineers and harness their joint potential.
<br/><br/>
## Who are we?
We are a collective of open-minded and skillful students from various universities who believe in the magic of interdisciplinary collaboration. We are artists, designers, and engineers who want to collaborate with those outside of our discipline to create novel work while having fun. 
<br/><br/>
## What do we do?
We provide the structure, resources, and mentorship necessary to support collaborative projects between artists, designers, and engineers. We facilitate projects that explore ideas around:
- creative expression through technology
- technology through creative expression
<br/><br/>
